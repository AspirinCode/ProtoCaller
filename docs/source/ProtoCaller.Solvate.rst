ProtoCaller.Solvate package
===========================

This package handles solvation of systems. So far, it only contains one
general function, :func:`~ProtoCaller.Solvate.solvate`, which should
be able to deal with most solvation scenarios. Keep in mind that this package
depends on a GROMACS binary being installed on your system and it being
accessible either via terminal or through a :code:`GROMACSHOME` environment
variable.
