ProtoCaller.Utils package
=========================

This package contains miscellaneous utilities that do not belong to other
packages and are mostly designed for internal use in ProtoCaller. The element
which will probably be of most use to the user is the :class:`~ProtoCaller.\
Utils.fileio.Dir` class, which makes nested directory creation and directory
switching much easier and less error-prone. Basic demonstration of how this
class is used can be found in the :doc:`Examples` section.
