Relative Solvation Free Energies
================================

Although ProtoCaller is mainly useful for relative binding free energy calculations, one can also use it for
relative solvation free energy calculations. Here we provide a simple example script, which generates hybrid
topology files from toluene to benzene in both solution and vacuum. You can see the same example for absolute
solvation free energies `here <https://protocaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.Absolute_Solvation.html>`_.
