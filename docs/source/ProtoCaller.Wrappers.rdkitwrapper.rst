ProtoCaller.Wrappers.rdkitwrapper module
========================================

This is an extensive wrapper around RDKit's functionality. Some of the featured functions
are high-level wrappers around RDKit's file parsers. Most of the functionality in this
module is centered around refining RDKit's maximum common substructure (MCS) algorithm
and using a custom alignment algorithm. Since this is the most challenging part of the
code, the user is strongly encouraged to always validate the resulting mappings and
alignments.
