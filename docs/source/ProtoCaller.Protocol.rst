ProtoCaller.Protocol package
============================

Here the user can find the :class:`~ProtoCaller.Protocol.Protocol` class,
which is designed to be a general bundle of an arbitrarily large set of
molecular dynamics parameters used for simulations. The API has been designed
to be general and interconvertible between packages. However, only GROMACS
.mdp files can be currently output. This will be addressed in future versions
of ProtoCaller.
