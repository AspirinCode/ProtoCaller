ProtoCaller.Wrappers.pdb2pqrwrapper module
==========================================

This module handles calls to a Python wrapped version of PDB2PQR. ProtoCaller
makes sure all PDB information is retained after calling PDB2PQR, such as
disulfide bond information, which is needed for subsequent parametrisation.
If the user runs external protonation routines, they need to make sure to
keep relevant PDB information afterwards.
